concurrency?
Assumed speed of cars = 24km/h (400m/min) 6.94m/s

simulate
- convert values 
- how to pan
- 2 lanes and 1, just positioning

build env 
- w/o env?
- create random traffic class
    - takes distance matrix as input
    - get current traffic

MAIN
- generate distance matrix 
- generate traffic matrix

SIMULATION
- draw the environment 3
- create a mapping of nodes 4
- loop through traffic matrix and generate cars 5
- create car object, when it collides increment and decrement and continue moving. disappear if carpark or entrance 6
- road object 


19-07
- generate cars based on road length
- add move for cars in different directions 1/3
- add cars one by one 4
- determine when car reaches end 1
- check if update traffic works 2

-complete map (matrix and drawing)
-add carpark to node and car park check
