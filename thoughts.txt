Assumed speed of cars = 24km/h (400m/min) 6.94m/s
-slowing down time with traffic and increasing speed 

---
test and train on light medium and heavy traffic
introduce surges and decreases in testing
random agent position
----
environment variations: traffic
cross-validation
---
all metrics
----
hyperparameter tuning
----
agent going out of bounds
---
decay


To do
-select to node before car movement bad? does it affect calculation of traffic and cause subseq cars adding to reward
-random agent position
-track time
-evaluation metrics
-test with full traffic



Friday
-build campus
-distances
-roundabout and u turns



Saturday

-generate, test and train on light medium and heavy traffic
-introduce surges and decreases in testing
-hyperparameter tuning
-decay
-select start node
-label buildings



Next week
-stop jumping of cars when straight
-turn car back for agent and car
-dont go back for cars
-prevent collisions- agent colliding
-cleanup
chnage obs and act space

-call to schedule
if today:
    patches, lines, park indicator
    say:finish campus, 
        add more variety to training, 
        more metrics for eval, 
        optimization,
        allow user select 
        no major roads, geocoding
else:
    do more
