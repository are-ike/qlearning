Assumed speed of cars = 24km/h (400m/min) 6.94m/s

---
test and train on light medium and heavy traffic
introduce surges and decreases in testing
random agent position
----
environment variations: traffic
cross-validation
---
all metrics
----
hyperparameter tuning
----
agent going out of bounds
---
decay


To do
-select to node before car movement bad? does it affect calculation of traffic and cause subseq cars adding to reward
-random agent position
-track time
-evaluation metrics
-test with full traffic
-cleanup
-prevent collisions- agent colliding

-distances
-build campus


Friday
-build campus
-roundabout and u turns
-dont go back for cars
-slowing down time with traffic and increasing speed 
-stop jumping of cars when straight


Saturday
-turn car back for agent and car
-generate, test and train on light medium and heavy traffic
-introduce surges and decreases in testing
-hyperparameter tuning
-decay
-select start node
-label buildings



-call to schedule
if today:
    patches, lines, park indicator
    say:finish campus, 
        add more variety to training, 
        more metrics for eval, 
        optimization,
        allow user select 
else:
    do more
